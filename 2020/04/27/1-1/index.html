        <p>Recently I read a book called <strong>How will you measure your life</strong> (partially), and I want to introduce three concepts mentioned in this book because these three concepts inspired me with new reflection on three aspects of life.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="The-Ticking-Clock"><a href="#The-Ticking-Clock" class="headerlink" title="The Ticking Clock"></a>The Ticking Clock</h1><blockquote>
<p> Almost paradoxically, the time when it is most important to invest in building strong families and close friendships is when it appears at the surface, as if it’s not necessary. P45</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="for-Now"><a href="#for-Now" class="headerlink" title="for Now"></a>for Now</h2><p>When I read this sentence in the book, I just want to sign with emotion “How time flies!” You know that you are now admitted into College, and you don’t have acquaintances at first in your college. So when you first come to HDU, you missed your high school friends.And you just realized that you don’t have too many friends when you are a high school student.</p>
<p>Why? Because you just don’t invest enough time to lay foundation for the bonds with your classmates. You seemed unsociable at high school. Because at that time I think that if you don’t put your heart into study, you won’t get admitted into a key university.But luckily, at least you can talk with ysj about recent developments and economics. I remember that usually we talk about many things on our way to Dong Fang Road.</p>
<p>But that is the history. The sentence inspired me because although I want to become better and better at college, I still need to invest in relationships with others. By how?** I think I can forge bonds by helping others.** First, I need to help my roommates. Now we are in different majors. I need their knowledge in terms of economics, administration and coding. Unexpectedly, I may need their help when graduating from college. I must treat my dormitory as my home so as to give them a feeling of their home. We are a new “family”.</p>
<p>It occurred to me that my two roommates had quarreled with each other when I was not in dormitory. As I came back and know about the situation, I just pulled them apart and talked with them respectively. If I don’t invest time in my roommates and just focus on study, it just meant to them that we were just not a family. I had to face it. You must realize that your success doesn’t just come from yourself. You need other people’s help. Only by helping others can they obey the rules you make.</p>
<h2 id="for-future"><a href="#for-future" class="headerlink" title="for future"></a>for future</h2><p>When I become a father, this sentence may have new meanings, especially for my child. I think that’s why parents should accompany their children when they were babies. </p>
<p>Research mentioned in the book found the importance of the earliest months of life are to the development of intellectual capacity. <strong>The number of words spoken to a child had a strong correlation between the number of words that they heard in their first thirty months and their performance on vocabulary and reading comprehension tests as they got older.</strong> If parents are more talkative and talk to their children in fully adult, sophisticated language, the impact on children’s cognitive development was enormous. And I think that’s one of the reasons why well-educated parents could cultivate well-rounded children. They talk to their children more rationally and formally. </p>
<p>But it is not unusual that many parents are busy with working so that they don’t have enough time to talk to children. So grandparents or nannies take this job. But the way they talk with children seems not to be qualified as the research suggested.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="The-school-of-experience"><a href="#The-school-of-experience" class="headerlink" title="The school of experience"></a>The school of experience</h1><p>This is also about the education. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tell them that if they’re not occasionally failing, then they’re not aiming high enough. Everyone knows how to celebrate success, but you should also celebrate failure if it’s as a result of a child striving for an out-of-reach goal.  P79</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Everyone wants to achieve success. No one wants to admit failure. That’s where the problem is. To me, my mother usually wants me to achieve high grades, and my dad usually comfort me when I get lost. The main reason I create this blog is to admit my failure and reflect on myself. Once I leave my parents, I need to do this job by myself. If you don’t admit failure, you will get depressed because you treat failure as disgrace, not a kind of blessing. </p>
<p>When I become a father, maybe I want my child to get high grades at school. So when he/she gets troubles, I will help them. Maybe I will finish the task for him/her. Rather than doing this, I think I’d better engineer a moment that will privately and gently embarrass my child. <strong>I think my job was not to help him finish the task but to design a bunch of experiences that can help him/her cultivate the capabilities to prepare them for life.</strong> I need to create challenges to let my child face and conquer them. Many people find it hard to come across some difficulties not because they are inherently incapable of succeeding but because they should have taken the courses to be prepared for them.</p>
<p>So the school is important. And I was thinking about my college life. Rather than getting rewards or medals in kinds of competitions, what I really need to get is the experience of participating in these competitions. I had to prepare myself for the workplace.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="Do-the-right-job"><a href="#Do-the-right-job" class="headerlink" title="Do the right job"></a>Do the right job</h1><p>This is a marketing concept.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When a company understands the jobs that arise in people’s lives, and then develops products and the accompanying experiences required in purchasing and using the product to do the job perfectly, it causes customers to instinctively “pull” the product into their lives whenever the job arises.    P54</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this is a similar concept that I used to read in <strong>the Power of Habit</strong>. The core is that your customers define your product. What causes you to buy a product is that you need to hire the product to do jobs for you.</p>
<p>In this book, the author took IKEA as an example to illustrate the concept of doing the right job. “Rather than organizing themselves around the characterization of particular customers or products, IKEA is structured around a job that customers periodically need to get down.” For what job? Get your home furnished. What IKEA provides is the Experiential Shopping. IKEA combines its products and layouts by setting a series of “scenes”. If you are hungry, you can get to the IKEA restaurant. And also they have same-day delivery. All IKEA does was to do the right job.</p>
<p>So next time when you think how to define a product, you need to think from the customer about what jobs they want to use your product to finish. Your product should fit the “job”.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h1><p>I think I need to write something after I read several books. Recently I haven’t read a lot of books. And I feel bored studying in home. I can’t help thinking that I could come back to college as quickly as possible. But, from another angle, there are less time that I can stay with my parents and especially my grandfather. I need to “invest “ more time in talking with and accompanying them.</p>
