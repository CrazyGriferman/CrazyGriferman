<p>1.Students will no longer have to chooses between being streamed into either “science based”or “liberal arts based”</p>
<p>2.taking “3+3”scheme:<br>— Compulsory tests (Chinese, maths and a foreign language) take place every June; 150 points per subject: two attempts for foreign language test<br>— Elective tests picked from 6 subjects (ideology and politics, history, geography, physics, chemistry, biology ) take place in May, just before compulsory tests<br>— Geography and biology take place in senior 2, in May<br>— Elective tests: chose 3 of 6 subjects: 70 points per subject: one attempt only (You will definitely gain 40 points if you pass the qualification tests, and 30 points are divided into 11 ranks, every 3 points is one rank, and is determined according to the total number of students.)<br>— Qualification tests: 12 subjects, including all compulsory and elective subjects, plus sports, art and ‘work’ class, in which students help with classroom chores; one attempt only.</p>
<p>3.Now we have Spring Gaokao and Summer Gaokao, and the final English test scores will be determined by the highest scores between Spring Gaokao and Autumn Gaokao.</p>
<p>4.The English test is now divided into two parts. One part is the writing examination, which are 140 points, and another part is the oral examination, which are 10 points.</p>
<p>5.applying the enrollment of speciality group</p>
<p>Facing so many changes, most of us as the third “white rats” like our seniors are confused.</p>
<h2 id="Firstly-I-will-talk-about-my-school’s-strategies-to-this-reform"><a href="#Firstly-I-will-talk-about-my-school’s-strategies-to-this-reform" class="headerlink" title="Firstly I will talk about my school’s strategies to this reform."></a>Firstly I will talk about my school’s strategies to this reform.</h2><p>The method of taking classes has changed. The former Gaokao model was “3+1”, the three compulsory tests (Chinese, maths and English) and one elective test picked from 6 subjects (ideology and politics, history, geography, physics, chemistry, biology), and the total scores were 600 points. And because if you wanted to choose good specialities, you needed to take the physics, so most of students in the past chose to pick physics. In the past, the class would be redivided, and students who picked the same elective subject would be put together, and we might have eight or nine classes choosing physics, and two classes choosing chemistry. Students who picked biology, history, geography were rare. But after the reform, our class was not redivided, and took the model of “going different classrooms to learn different elective subjects”(most of the high schools in Shanghai took this model), and we would take classes of Chinese, Maths, English together, and take classes of elective subjects in different classes.</p>
<p>Additionally,  when the Gaokao of elective subjects approached, the classes of compulsory subjects were stopped ,and all classes would be used to revise the elective subjects.</p>
<h2 id="Subsequently-I-want-to-talk-about-well-rounded-evaluation"><a href="#Subsequently-I-want-to-talk-about-well-rounded-evaluation" class="headerlink" title="Subsequently I want to  talk about well-rounded evaluation"></a>Subsequently I want to  talk about well-rounded evaluation</h2><p>This way to enroll is a little bit similar to the model of enrollment in United States, but it has a lot of differences too.</p>
<p><strong>Firstly, this model of enrollment has the requirements of points.</strong> Your scores must be higher than the admission score of key universities.</p>
<p><strong>Secondly, it doesn’t mean that if your scores are higher than the required scores of the university enrollment, you can go to take the well-rounded evaluation test.</strong> You need to upload the materials needed to apply for this university in advance on the platform of well-rounded evaluation enrollment. (including personal statements, research study report). And if you pass the preliminary examination, and your scores are higher than the qualified score line, you then have the qualifications for the interview. You can upload different materials to different cities, but you can go to only one university to take the exam, which determined by the sequence of the university you fill in a form. And when the university decides the number of qualified students, it is submitted 1:1.5. For example, if the university wanted to enroll 100 students, it will first recruit 150 students, and will enroll 100 in 150 students.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the well-rounded evaluation enrollment platform</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The well-rounded enrollment is not just determined by your Gaokao scores, and the scores of interview account for a lot. These two scores are converted into a total score. And students are enrolled based on the total score. </p>
<p>From the bright side, This model of the enrollment benefits those who get high marks, which increase the possibilities to be admitted into the elite school like FDU and Jiao Tong University. But for ordinary students, the well-rounded evaluation has nothing to do with them. If you want to be qualified for well-rounded enrollment, the Gaokao score is a hard and fast indicator. If you fail to approach the qualified score, then you don’t need to think about well-rounded evaluation enrollment.</p>
<p><strong>And what is about the contents of interview?</strong></p>
<p>According to my classmates, the interviewer will inquire about the contents of the personal statements and research study report you formerly uploaded, and the interview largely examine the richness of students’ thinking.</p>
<p><strong>And what is the research study report?</strong> Actually when I was in senior 1, we didn’t even know that we should write this report. And in the first week of senior 2, our teacher distributed sheets of paper which included many research topics. Students formed the groups to jointly write the report, including the ‘science based’ and ‘liberal arts based’ topics, and you can also choose your own topic. Through searching for the materials, practicing, and investigating, students wrote the report around this topic. By reading the report, the interviewer can to a large extent see the all-round education of students, and it is one of the reasons why that report is consequential.</p>
<p>But, we knew it until we were senior 2 grades, and we only had two weeks to write this report. The time was too short! If we wanted to spare no effort to do it, it should take at least half an year. So we had to take a perfunctory attitude towards this report. ( Acutally there were just a few students who were finally qualified for well-rounded evaluation enrollment, so the report was useless to most of students )</p>
<h2 id="So-what-is-the-flaw-of-Shanghai-Gaokao-reform"><a href="#So-what-is-the-flaw-of-Shanghai-Gaokao-reform" class="headerlink" title="So what is the flaw of Shanghai Gaokao reform?"></a>So what is the flaw of Shanghai Gaokao reform?</h2><p>When you search for your scores of elective subjects, you will just get a sole rank, not the concrete score. For example, if you take the chemistry examination and get 68 scores on your test paper, and you are ranked as the last 5 percent of students who picked chemistry, you will finally get E, which means 0 point. In addition, the luck counts. students who get A rank are all a little bit lucky. Because students can only see the rank, it will make students depressed. (considering that you learn chemistry for three years and the result of it is only a sole rank which determines your study). And another problem is that because biology and geography examination are taken in senior 2, usually in May, and we will know the rank shortly after the exam about half a month, if you get low points, it may influence your confidence and the subsequent subject you take.</p>
<p><strong>One of the biggest pitfalls in this reform is that it is adverse for the university to enroll students.</strong> Because students who picked physics mainly come from the municipal level key high schools, their scores are high, which result to the fierce competition of physics as well as chemistry. So many students picked history and ideology and politic as their elective subjects so that they can get high points. This leads to the phenomenon that students who picked physics and chemistry decrease. Because of this, many students fail to pass the physics and chemistry examination in university. But that’s not the case before the Gaokao. Students who pick history and ideology and politics will get high points, which makes them more likely to be admitted into key universities, but it is not conducive to the selection of outstanding student because some of the high-scoring students who are recruited may have just studied physics or chemistry for one year.</p>
<p>And even though students pick physics and chemistry, because the difficulties of the examination decrease largely after the reform which results to the fact that we just learn basic knowledge of chemistry and physics, mainly from the textbook, they will find that students from other province have learnt many things in high school which we don’t learn in high school.</p>
<p><strong>Another point is that only students in Shanghai can use the calculator when taking the Maths examination.</strong> It leads to the weakness of our ability to calculate. And because our textbook is much more easier than PEP’s version, students also have learnt things we don’t learn. So it is quite hard for us to pass the advanced tests.</p>
<p><strong>In my opinion, this reform did not decrease students’ burden but increased the competition.</strong> Many students now have to go to the tutorial center at weekends so as to keep up with the teaching progress。</p>
<h2 id="But-we-also-benefit-a-lot-from-this-reform"><a href="#But-we-also-benefit-a-lot-from-this-reform" class="headerlink" title="But we also benefit a lot from this reform."></a>But we also benefit a lot from this reform.</h2><p>The difficulty of Chinese and English test examination improves, especially English, which I think is a good thing because it can greatly enhance the English competitiveness of students in college.And the emergence of well-rounded recruitment has increased the chances of candidates with upper-middle grades being admitted into key universities.</p>
<p><strong>Another very consequential point is that we now fill out the application after the Gaokao scores are issued</strong>, so we can compare our scores with previous years’ scores. In the past, students can only fill out the application before Gaokao.</p>
<p><strong>Another good thing is that in addition to the enrollment of Autumn Gaokao, many colleges and universities also enroll students in Spring Gaokao.</strong> Spring Gaokao and Autumn Gaokao are different. Spring Gaokao only contains 450 points (three compulsory examinations), and many students with low rank of biology or geography will choose to “go away” in Spring Gaokao, which is equivalent to giving students another chance.</p>
<h2 id="Next-let’s-talk-about-the-change-of-the-Gaokao-application-filling-system"><a href="#Next-let’s-talk-about-the-change-of-the-Gaokao-application-filling-system" class="headerlink" title="Next, let’s talk about the change of the Gaokao application filling system."></a>Next, let’s talk about the change of the Gaokao application filling system.</h2><p>Because of the reform, we can fill out 24 parallel Gaokao applications, which are 24 speciality groups. <strong>What is a speciality group?</strong> That is, the school will “package” different specialities into one group. When you fill out the application, you first select a speciality group, then you can choose at most three majors in a speciality group. When considering the adjustment, your speciality will only be adjusted in the speciality group you select. For example, Hangzhou Dianzi University has three specialty groups. The speciality group 1 includes “material engineering” and “communication engineering” and “biomedical engineering”, then the speciality group 2 includes “computer science”, and”management science and engineering”, and the speciality group 3 includes “economics”, “sociology” and “ industrial design”. Moreover, when selecting a speciality group, there will be requirements for the elective subjects. For example, the speciality group 1 requires you to choose one subject among biology, chemistry, and physics, while the speciality group 2 requires you to choose one subject between physics and chemistry, and the professional group three does not have the requirements.</p>
<p><strong>The trap of the speciality group enrollment is that many schools will put a school’s ace major and some not-so-good majors in a speciality group.</strong> If you want to apply for that major, you have to take the rick of adjustment to other majors which are in the speciality groups.</p>
<p>However, <strong>some schools will take another approach.</strong> For example, East China University of Political Science and Law “packaged” its ace speciality (law direction) into a speciality group, the original admission score of East China University of Political Science and Law should be lower than Shanghai University, but now because of the approach to ‘package’ ace speciality, East China University of Political Science has higher enrollment scores than the three speciality groups of Shanghai University, which is a strategy for college recruitment.</p>
<h2 id="Then-I-would-like-to-provide-food-for-‘where-to-go-about-our-high-school-education"><a href="#Then-I-would-like-to-provide-food-for-‘where-to-go-about-our-high-school-education" class="headerlink" title="Then I would like to provide food for ‘where to go about our high school education"></a>Then I would like to provide food for ‘where to go about our high school education</h2><p>A big problem that emerged after the reform was that <strong>due to the diversity of three elective subjects combination, many schools lacked teachers, especially biology teachers, to open the course.</strong> Many schools were unable to open the biology course in senior 2 because of the lack of biology teachers so that they took the biology examination in senior 3. And there was a phenomenon that a teacher may teach more then ten classes (when I was in senior 1, the biology teacher taught eight classes), which led to a growing strength gap between schools and schools. Schools with scarce teachers are unable to open several courses under the background of the Gaokao reform. Another problem was the oral English class. Some schools lacked the resources, which may lead to the phenomenon that students never simulated the oral English test on the computer before the formal test. When I was in senior 3, we had a English oral class every week, but in the second semester, we could only practice our oral English maybe once a month.</p>
<p>I used to read a book before called <strong><em>The Road to the University</em></strong>. The author Wu Jun said in the preface: “When I went to college, the biggest reward was not how much knowledge I have learned in books, but learning a lot of things from teachers and classmates.” I am very grateful to my high school teachers, especially my Chinese teachers and English teachers, even under the Gaokao reform, they are still igniting my passion for learning knowledge!</p>
<p><strong>The first teacher I want to talk about is my Chinese teacher Dong.</strong> I still remembered that he let us divide into several groups, which were respectively in charge of lectures, essays, reading, etc. Then I was assigned to the reading group. Teacher Dong asked each of group to select a team leader. Since no one wanted to be the leader, I was just in the saddle. And I was mainly responsible for reading the notes. The main work was that every week I urged the whole class to read books and write a reading note after reading books, and then handed it in. After I collected the reading notes, I would hand them in to Teacher Dong. <strong>During senior 1, my enthusiasm for reading was ignited.</strong> I remembered that when I was in senior 1, I probably only read more than twenty books, mainly about literature and philosophy. When I was in senior 2, I read more than 100 books a year. When I was in senior 3, I started to try to read the original version books. </p>
<p>In addition, every Friday in Chinese class, Mr. Dong stipulated that two people should come to the stage to give a speech for 5 minutes. When I was in senior 1, I was a relative introvert. I remembered that the theme I first talked about was “Artificial Intelligence.” At that time, I was very ashamed, and the speech I gave was awful. <strong>This was the first time I had addressed a speech to all my classmates since I was a child. I had never gave a speech publicly before. Although my first speech was terrible, I stepped out of my “comfort zone” and improved myself greatly!</strong> I reckoned that the reason why I could give a fluent speech now had a lot to do with Teacher Dong’s encouragement. </p>
<p><strong>He also encouraged us to write.</strong> In senior 1, Teacher Dong asked us to write an essay every week. The subject matter was not limited, and there were no concrete topics. We wrote what we wanted to write. And the essay would be handed in to the ‘essay group’ to write the comments. And then Teacher Dong would personally wrote a comment on every essay every time. I saw that some students wrote novels, and he also wrote a lot of comments to encourage them to continue. My Chinese test scores were not very good in the class, but because of Teacher Dong’s encouragement, I would never gave up my love for Chinese!</p>
<p>In fact, my English was very poor in senior 1 and senior 2 largely resulting from the fact that I didn’t study well in middle school. In high school I didn’t like my first teacher’s teaching style. However, when I was in senior 2,  because our teacher had sickness and asked for a break, a substitute teacher from another school came , named Zhou.(I called her Teacher Zhou) <strong>What I never thought was that the substitute teacher ignited my passion for learning English!</strong> She did two things and changed my attitude towards English learning. The first one is that once the teacher arranged the homework of making the sentence by using words we learned. I don’t know if I was doing the homework seriously or other reasons, in the next day, I found out that three sentences I made were placed on the screen by Teacher Zhou for the whole class to watch! ! I was really excited at the time. <strong>This was the first time I have been publicly praised for my English homework since middle school! !</strong></p>
<p><strong>The second thing was that when I was learning another unit, the teacher chose me and a girl to perform a melodrama.</strong> I didn’t know why she chose me, maybe because my sound of reading English was loud. Before she came I was basically a “marginal character” in the English class, and the teacher didn’t pay much attention to me because my English test scores were very poor. But all of a sudden I started to have a strong interest in English learning! Although we only read a few lines in this melodrama, I was really serious about the melodrama and the results were quite good. Although, my rank was still at the bottom of the class when Teacher Zhou left at the end of the semester, in my heart I ignited the enthusiasm about English learning! </p>
<p>Remembering that during the summer vacation from senior 2 to senior 3, I made three plans corresponding to three periods, and I studied English for at least three hours per day. I got up at 5:45 in the morning, and then I took the earliest bus to the library. Because there was about an hour on the road, I spent that time remembering vocabulary. Without Teacher Zhou, I couldn’t have such a strong interest in English.I learnt according to the plan during the summer vacation from senior 2 to senior 3, and to an extent I was numb to learn in middle and later periods of the summer vacation. But now looking back, it has been undoubtedly the most fulfilling summer vacation in my life so far, I sincerely thank Teacher Zhou And Teacher Dong.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>my plan during the summer holiday</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I remember that at the end of senior 2, my English test rank was almost at the bottom of the class, and the grade ranking was at the bottom too (there were only about 450 people in the second year).</p>
<p><img src="https://i.loli.net/2019/11/22/GqHZt3us4eEC9P6.png" alt></p>
<blockquote>
<p>my rank at the second semester of senior 2</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I was in senior 3, I rose from 393 to ‘100+’.</p>
<p>My efforts were not in vain, and my passion was ignited.<br>In senior 3, I also learned English as earnestly as possible. We took English examinations twice. I scored 113 points in the first try, and I scored 122 points in the second try. It should be in the top ten of the class.</p>
<p>Under the baton of Gaokao, we had to compromise on scores, but <strong>there were some teachers who always tried to ignite student’s eager to study what they truly wanted to learn.</strong> Even under the background of the Gaokao Reform, they still hope that students will not only take away the admission notice of a famous university from high school, but the desire for knowledge, the planning for the future and the passion for lifelong learning. <br><strong>There are also some teachers, although I don’t like their teaching style very much, but their quality is worth learning for life.</strong> My high school motto is  “being responsible”. In my opinion, my chemistry teacher is the most “responsible” teacher I have ever seen in my high school. In the first year of high school, she created a set of “characteristic points” system in order to better manage the class, which included “group tasks”, “class committee work”, “radio calisthenics”, “ Chinese writing from memory”, “English dictation” , “homework of each subject”, “labor”, “study hall discipline”, etc. the following table is what Teacher Li makes</p>
<p><img src="https://i.loli.net/2019/11/22/VanyiFCjSu19kU2.png" alt></p>
<blockquote>
<p>the table</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Teacher Li made the table once a week, and she sticked to doing it for two years. I showed great respect for teacher Li’s perseverance and responsible attitude towards class work. She told us that because she was old, she seemed to be in poor health. After sitting for a long time, she couldn’t endure the pain and now she could only stand and correct the test paper. She had to correct two classes of test paper in one evening, Teacher Li could just stand for several hours to correct the papers. Although I think her class was boring and I may not remember what she taught me, I will never forget her spirit of “responsibility” in teaching and working!</p>
<p>Under the background of Gaokao, I am fortunate because I studied in a municipal level key high school, and the teaching resources are sufficient, and the study pressure is not very high. This has led me to spend a lot of time reading extracurricular books to learn what I am interested in.</p>
<p><strong>I may forget what books I have read in high school and the contents of books, but it will benefit my life forever from the humanistic quality that it brought to me and the quality I have learned from my teachers.</strong></p>
<p>Although the aim of Shanghai Gaokao Reform may serve for the ‘so-called’ well-rounded education, if the students do not study proactively, and only learn the contents of the textbooks, whatever the reform becomes, it can’t make those students become well-rounded because they are passively learning knowledge.</p>
<p>Maybe students can surpass teachers through self-study, so <strong>what is the value of the teacher? It is significant that students will eventually exceed teachers, but in the course of study road teachers act as characters that motivate and encourage students to continue learning when encountering difficulties and setbacks.</strong> Many students’ interest in a particular subject may be due to teacher’s vivid teaching style, which ignited their passion for that subject.</p>
<p>Wu Jun wrote on the cover of <strong><em>The Road to the University</em></strong> <strong>“A good university is the home of young people, and the best place for them to spend their lives.”</strong> I believe that my high school and middle school are also my home. No matter where I go, I will not forget the ‘home training’ —— “being grateful” and “being responsible”.</p>
<p>In my opinion, I think that the sole reform of the Gaokao education system is useless. <strong>The key is to increase the salary of teachers</strong>, especially teachers struggling in the front line of Senior 3 and junior 3 so as to attract more talented people to be teachers. Now the teachers who work in tutorial centers are paid very high, but teachers in school actually have very low wages according to what they said and the Ministry of Education prohibits teachers in school from tutoring students in their leisure time and receiving money.</p>
<p><strong>Another point is that what kind of talents we should attract to be teachers.</strong> Those who have the experience of studying abroad must be the candidates, because in this case, those students, if becoming teachers, will teach students combined with their own experience, especially the experience of studying abroad. If you have studied abroad, it can greatly expand your horizon. Gradually they foster student’s thoughts they learned abroad like lifelong learning. And they may not judge students only according to their marks.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusions"><a href="#Conclusions" class="headerlink" title="Conclusions"></a>Conclusions</h2><p>Ren Zhengfei used to say: <strong>“The prosperity of a country is fostered on the platform of classroom in primary schools!”</strong> I don’t expect that our Gaokao education system will be similar to well-rounded education. <strong>I only hope that more people who have received higher education abroad can become teachers, especially teachers in primary schools or middle schools, because I believe that only teachers with broad horizons can greatly broaden students’ horizons.</strong> This is a challenge at present because the salaries of teachers working in the Fundamental Education Services industry are very low, and it is possible that students who study abroad may think that it is not worthwhile just being a primary or middle school teacher. I think that the change of this concept will take efforts in several generations.</p>
