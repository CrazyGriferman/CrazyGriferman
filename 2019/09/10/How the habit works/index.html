        <p>In daily life, we often find that when we have some behaviors, we don’t do them consciously.Instead, we do these things automatically, like wearing clothes, brushing and so on.When we learn new things, or something we don’t get familiar with, we need to mentally make efforts greatly on them.</p>
<p>But why? The fact is that <strong>we do several things so frequently that they just have become habits.</strong></p>
<h2 id="What-is-habit"><a href="#What-is-habit" class="headerlink" title="What is habit"></a>What is habit</h2><p><strong>Habits, in my opinion, are automatic behaviors we do frequently.</strong> They, like codes, are stored in part of our brains called basal ganglia.Take rider and elephant as an analogy, <strong>elephant provides the energy but can’t remember the road until the rider tells it where to go.Our mind, like rider, providing the planning and direction.In fact, our mind has limited space and often forget the behavior we once did.</strong></p>
<p>So basically, the habit is something that is hard to form. But once we know what the habit is composed of, we can form a habit, change a habit, and even transform the habit into what we want.</p>
<p>In essence, <strong>habit emerges because the brain is constantly looking for ways to save efforts.</strong></p>
<h2 id="the-composition-of-habits"><a href="#the-composition-of-habits" class="headerlink" title="the composition of habits"></a>the composition of habits</h2><p>To understand a habit, there are three things we need to know: <strong>cue, routine, and reward</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="Cue"><a href="#Cue" class="headerlink" title="Cue"></a>Cue</h3><blockquote>
<p><strong>Cue is a trigger that tells your brain to go into automatic mode and which habit to use.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In real life, the cue is everywhere. When we get up, we definitely will wear the clothes, brush, and wash face. So ‘getting up’ is a cue. It triggers a series of actions that you always do every morning.In advertisement, you can see the cue too, and more frequently. A fat guy want to become thin.A dirty cloth needs to be clean.An old man needs vitamin to keep healthy.</p>
<p><strong>When the cue emerged in real life, our mind just stopped thinking and got ready to make automatic behaviors.</strong>But in advertisement, as the video flows ,we saw a story beginning with a cue, how the products used ,and what we could get from the products. By watching the advertisement frequently, we just form a habit created by advertisers so that we are more like to use their products instead of other brands.</p>
<h3 id="Routine"><a href="#Routine" class="headerlink" title="Routine"></a>Routine</h3><blockquote>
<p><strong>Then there is the routine, which can be physical or mental or emotional.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The routine, normally, is the thing we do in a habit loop. Usually, we are unconscious while in routine because we are yearning for the reward, our mind is in the future when our body is at present in the routine doing such ‘boring’ things. </p>
<p><strong>One of the reasons we want to create different kinds of habits is that we want to skip the pressure and stress brought by routines.</strong> Routines are often boring and we all want to skip it and just directly get the reward. But we can’t. Only by creating the habit loop can we form a system that make it available for people to alleviate the physical and mental stress.</p>
<h3 id="Reward"><a href="#Reward" class="headerlink" title="Reward"></a>Reward</h3><blockquote>
<p><strong>Finally, there is a reward, which helps your brain figure out if this particular loop is worth remembering for the future.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reward is an interesting thing. In fact, we can’t absolutely confirm whether the reward is worth taking. When we get reward, we might feel upset because maybe the reward is what we don’t want.But before getting rewards, they are hopes. Without reward, the habit loop will easily collapse.Except directing the path, only when the rider told the elephant what reward it can get can it obey the rider’s command.</p>
<h3 id="Investment"><a href="#Investment" class="headerlink" title="Investment"></a>Investment</h3><p>In <strong><em>The Power of Habit</em></strong>, the author just told these three elements. But the author of <strong><em>Hooked</em></strong> thought of investment as also an important element of habits.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The investment occurs when the user puts something into the product or service such as time, data, effort, social capital, or money.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When users use an app, as they invest more into the products, they will get harder to move from this app to another one.The habit is so consolidated that users can’t delete it because they will lose their all investments in this app.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-change-a-habit"><a href="#How-to-change-a-habit" class="headerlink" title="How to change a habit"></a>How to change a habit</h2><blockquote>
<p><strong>If you use the same cue, and provide the same reward, you can shift the routine and change the habit, Almost any behavior can be transformed if the cue and reward stay the same.</strong> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>At present we have learnt that <strong>a habit is composed of cue, routine, reward and investment.</strong> Certainly, changing a habit is hard because it has been stored in our mind. So to change a habit, not only do we need internal power, but the external power also matters.</p>
<p>You may first remember the willpower, which can help us stick to what we want to do. But according to psychology, <strong>willpower is an exhaustible resource</strong>, like muscle.</p>
<p>For example, you may remember the plans you make at the beginning of a year. At first, you stick to doing what you plan.But as the time flows, you get bored with those things and give up halfway. In the process of sticking to your plan, your willpower become weaker and weaker. And it becomes so powerless that it can’t help you move forward.</p>
<p>So willpower alone can’t help you change a habit.</p>
<p>So what do we need else?</p>
<p>We need external power. We can see that religions give people belief and force people to make their obligations. Belief give people the hope to change habits, but belief alone is not enough because if just you alone believe it, the belief is too weak to drive you. In addition, <strong>you need to incorporate the belief into a group or a community so that once everyone share the belief, this power will strengthen it.</strong><br>You need to find those who also want to change what you want to change, like joining an association. I used to read that if you want to give up your drunk habits, you need to join a group where other people also want to give it up. You need to share your drunk history to other members and members will supervise each other whether drunk or not.</p>
<p>Now that you find a way to give up your drunk habits and feel happy about it, is that enough?</p>
<p>When you get depressed or negative emotions, what will you do to come across these difficulties?<br>“I don’t know, maybe i drink alcohol again”.</p>
<p><strong>Giving up a habit is not enough, you need to find another one to fill this vacancy.</strong></p>
<p>You see, the cue is once you get negative emotions and the reward is that you get happy (maybe) . The cue and the reward stay the same, and what matters is the routine. You need to find a new routine to change the habit successfully. In my opinion, once a habit is formed, it can’t be eliminated totally, it must hide in your mind, and other habits just conceal it. Once the habit is triggered, if you didn’t transformed the routine, it will occur again.</p>
<p>Additionally, <strong>if you want to change a habit, you must focus on just one habit to change, don’t try to change two or more habits simultaneously. If you just focus on one, believe me, it will cause chain reaction and make it easier to change subsequent habits.</strong></p>
<h2 id="How-to-form-a-habit"><a href="#How-to-form-a-habit" class="headerlink" title="How to form a habit"></a>How to form a habit</h2><blockquote>
<p><strong>These services seem at first to be offering nice-to-have vitamins, but once the habit is established, they provide an on-going pain remedy.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once I listened to a Ted Talk. The speaker told that if we want to create a habit, we need at least 21 days.But once reading <strong><em>The Power of Habit</em></strong> and <strong><em>Hooked</em></strong>, I know that it is not as easy as the speaker said. Advertisers are constantly managing to let us form a habit of using their products. So to form a habit, we must learn from the advertisements.</p>
<p>You see, classic advertisements always have classic sentences and characters:</p>
<p><strong>Beauty outside. Beast Inside</strong> for Mac Pro</p>
<p><strong>Just do it</strong> for Nike</p>
<p><strong>Uncle McDonald</strong> for McDonald</p>
<p>They are cues, impressing their products and brand on us.But only the cues, routines and rewards are suitable can the product be accepted by customers.<br>For example, a company called Procter &amp; Gamble wanted to turn a spray called Febreze into a billion-dollar business.</p>
<p>They designed two TV commercials.</p>
<p>The first shows a woman talking about the smoking section of a restaurant.</p>
<p>The cue is the smell of cigarettes. The reward is the odor eliminated from clothes.</p>
<p>The second ad featured a woman worrying about her dog’s smell.</p>
<p>The cue is pet smells, which are familiar to the seventy million households with animals. The reward is a house that doesn’t smell like a kennel.</p>
<p>They aired these two ad and then found:</p>
<p>Febreze was a dud.</p>
<p>What happened? Actually the pet’s owner rarely noticed the pet’s smell and found it useless to use Febreze.</p>
<p>The routine is to use Febreze, but the cue and the reward they figured out are wrong.</p>
<p>The researchers of P&amp;G again visited customers and casually found one woman used it frequently. She said” Spraying feels like a little mini-celebration when I’m done with a room.”</p>
<p>With seeing other thousands of hours of videotapes of people cleaning their homes, the researchers found the new cue and reward.</p>
<p>The tagline of TV commercials changed from “Gets bad smells out of fabrics” to “clean life’s smells”.</p>
<p><strong>Old cue: pet smells</strong></p>
<p><strong>New Cue: cleaning a room, making a bed, or vacuuming a rug.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Old reward:a house that doesn’t smell like a kennel.</strong></p>
<p><strong>New reward:the nice smell that occurs at the end of a clean</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead of eliminating scents on dirty fabrics, it became an air freshener used as the finishing touch, once things are already clean.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>We should form habits for a choice or something we enjoy because it helps sb. else instead of  following orders, which will make willpower muscles get tired much faster.</strong></p>
<p>When I study in the middle school and high school, I find that if you want to form the habit of reading, you must read what you want to read, not the books teachers forcing you to read for homework. Once I read books for homework, I was just very bored with these books and quickly got sleep.But if I read what I deliberately choose from library or online stores, I would feel excited about reading them, like <strong><em>On Top of Tides</em></strong>.Perhaps this is the function of habits.</p>
<h2 id="Habits-in-firms-no-practical-example-just-theory"><a href="#Habits-in-firms-no-practical-example-just-theory" class="headerlink" title="Habits in firms(no practical example, just theory)"></a>Habits in firms(no practical example, just theory)</h2><p>Now that we can form and change our personal habits for bettering ourselves, leaders can also do this for bettering companies.</p>
<p>To be more concrete, leaders can create corporate cultures by creating keystone habits where new values became ingrained. Leaders should identify a few key priorities that staff should do and obey.And leaders must regularly reflect on firm’s habits and strategic orientations coming from the firm’s past. </p>
